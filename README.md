### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer who really likes to write, learn and to share. That's why I started Axokoi.com 
- ðŸ”­ My side projects are for the moment mainly focused on BandurriaJ! A JavaFx/SpringBoot desktop application for tagging and management of Music discs. You can visit it here --> https://github.com/AxoKoi/BandurriaJ Help would be really appreciated!
