### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer who really likes to write, learn and to share. 

- ðŸ”­ As our daily lives become more and more digital, I have been increasingly aware of the environmental and social impacts of technology. I believe that software should be designed with the environment and society in mind, and that is why I created Axoly Tech, a company focused on responsible IT. We are committed to creating software that is both sustainable and ethical.
